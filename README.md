## What is CodeEasy?

CodeEasy is one of the most unique methods I've come across in teaching a programming language. Instead of learning C# via a Textbook or YouTube tutorial format with no meaningful connections between topics, it immerses you in a futuristic dystopian planet Earth where the survival of humanity depends on you learning C#! The best part about CodeEasy is the lack of "hand-holding" along the way. Although it's not necessarily LeetCode or CodeWars, it's one of the best stepping stones in getting the hang of C#.

## Tier System

There are three tiers (difficulties) of questions/challenges you can progress through, these are:

## No Plagiarism
If you are having any trouble with a specific problem please use the CodeEasy Forum or Community Solution on the problem in question. Asking/posting questions and sparking up a conversation with somebody is much more impactful to your learning than copying code.
